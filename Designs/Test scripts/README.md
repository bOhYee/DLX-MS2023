# DLX test environments
The two main tests used to verify the behaviour of the DLX are collected in this folder, together with their compiled version:
- **Bubble sort algorithm** implementation, used to verify the correctness of the comparisons, branch evaluations, forwarding and memory load and store instructions;

- **Euclidean algorithm** (GCD computation) implementation, used to verify the functional aspect of forwarding, multiplication and division instructions.
