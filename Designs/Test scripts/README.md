# DLX behaviour verification programs
The two main tests used to verify the behaviour of the DLX are collected in this folder, together with their compiled version:
- a **Bubble sort algorithm** implementation, used to verify the correctness of the comparisons, branch evaluations, forwarding and memory load/store instructions;

- an implementation of the **Euclidean algorithm** (GCD computation), used to verify the functional aspect of forwarding, multiplication and division instructions.
